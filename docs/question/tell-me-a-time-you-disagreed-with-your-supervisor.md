# Tell me a time you disagreed with your supervisor.

Interviewers wants to believe you can **speck out your thought**, not a **yes man**.

Prepare for this with **a solid real case** to show your **unique value**, use a case that could interest the interviewer to ask more about it.

When speaking, follow this template: situation → obstacles → actions → result
