# How does `instanceOf` work? difference with `typeof`

[typeof](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeOf) is commonly used but it is not so useful in case of complex object data types. It would be a shining point if you could mention some alternative.

You need to understand the internal logic of how [instanceOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/instanceof) works.
