# implement Merge Sort

## Question
Even for Front-End Engineer, it is a must to understand how basic sorting algorithms work.

Now you are asked to implement [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort), which sorts an integer array in ascending order.

Do it **in-place**, no need to return anything.

_Follow-up_

What is time cost for average / worst case ? Is it stable?

## Code
:::: code-group
::: code-group-item javascript:active
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 */
function mergeSort(arr) {
  // your code here
}
```
