# What does a HTTP request look like?

## Question
This is a topic usually Front End developers don't touch. If asked, the interviewers want you to explain the [HTTP messages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages).

Be sure to know the general structure of HTTP message and the difference between HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2.
