# Tell me a goal you set and you managed to achieve.

## Question
Interviewers want to believe you **can be motivated**, and even better, "could be self-motivated".

Prepare for this with **a solid real case** to show your **unique value**, use a case that could interest the interviewer to ask more about it.

When speaking, follow this template: situation → obstacles → actions → result
