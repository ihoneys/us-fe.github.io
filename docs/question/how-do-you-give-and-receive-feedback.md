# How do you give and receive feedback?

It is not all happiness in your daily work, not everybody is your friend, but you need to **Be objective** when giving feedback and also when receiving them.

And there are multiple ways to give feedback, in the company review system, talk privately , talk in public, or talk to his/her boss, .etc. Which is the best depends on the situation and your relationship.

Prepare for this with **a solid real case** to show your **unique value**, use a case that could interest the interviewer to ask more about it.

When speaking, follow this template: situation → obstacles → actions → result
