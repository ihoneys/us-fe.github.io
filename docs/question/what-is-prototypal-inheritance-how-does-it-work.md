# What is Prototypal Inheritance? How does it work?

## Question
It is hard to explain something clearly. I'd suggest you take a top-down approach for this kind of abstract concept.

for example.

1.  generally what it is
2.  what does it consist of , how does it work
3.  what can we gain by using it
4.  what we need to pay attention to .
5.  ....

If you are not familiar with Prototype, I recommend you first thoroughly read this [article from JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/prototypes).

Good Luck!
