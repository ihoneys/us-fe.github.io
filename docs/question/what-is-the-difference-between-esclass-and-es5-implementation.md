# What is the difference between ES6 Class and ES5 implementation?

## Question
There is even a coding problem on BFE.dev to write a "class" in ES5. [53\. write your own `extends` in es5](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/write-your-own-extends-in-es5).

But there are things added to ES6 which are impossible in ES5. Here is [a good article to explain this](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-introducing-javascript-classes). Or you can take a look at this [Stackoverflow thead](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36419713/are-es6-classes-just-syntactic-sugar-for-the-prototypal-pattern-in-javascript).
