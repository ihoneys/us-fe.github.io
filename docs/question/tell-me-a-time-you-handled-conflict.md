# Tell me a time you handled conflict.

## Question
People have different opinions on same thing, that's for sure.

When facing conflicts, you'd better **see the whole picture**, sometimes it is good to persuade others, sometimes it is not, depends on the situation.

Tell the interviewer your general rule, and prepare for this with **a solid real case** to show your **unique value**, use a case that could interest the interviewer to ask more about it.

When speaking, follow this template: situation → obstacles → actions → result
