# Tell me  a time you acted beyond your responsibility.

Interviewers want to believe you **take the ownership** and are **self-motivated**.

Prepare for this with **a solid real case** to show your **unique value**, use a case that could interest the interviewer to ask more about it.

When speaking, follow this template: situation → obstacles → actions → result
