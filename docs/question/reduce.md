## Question
What does the code snippet to the right output by `console.log`?

> There was a mistake in this problem and Thanks to [pinglu85](https://bigfrontend.dev/user/pinglu85) for pointing it out. It is fixed now.

## Snippet
```js
[1,2,3].reduce((a,b) => {
  console.log(a,b)
});

[1,2,3].reduce((a,b) => {
  console.log(a,b)
}, 0)
```
