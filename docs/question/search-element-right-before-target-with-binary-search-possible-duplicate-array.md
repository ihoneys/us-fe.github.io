# search element right before target with Binary Search(possible duplicate array)

This is a variation of [37\. implement Binary Search (unique)](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-Binary-Search-Unique).

Your are given a sorted ascending array of number, but **might have duplicates**, you are asked to return the **element right before first appearance** of a target number.

If not found return `undefined`.

_note_

Please don't use `Array.prototype.indexOf()`, it is not our goal.
