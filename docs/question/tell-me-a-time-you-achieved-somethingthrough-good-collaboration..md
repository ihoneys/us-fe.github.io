# Tell me a time you achieved something through good collaboration.

## Question
Interviewer doesn't want to hear about the common cliche, they want to here something **unique** that

1.  you met the problem but you couldn't solve it by yourself
2.  you collaborated with other members, but it was hard
3.  you talked with other members, found the cure and everything became smooth
4.  got great outcome, you were highly evaluated, the teamwork was perfect.

Prepare for this with **a solid real case** to show your **unique value**, use a case that could interest the interviewer to ask more about it.

When speaking, follow this template: situation → obstacles → actions → result
