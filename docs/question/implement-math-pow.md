# implement `Math.pow()`

Can you write your own [Math.pow()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/pow) ? The power would only be integers.

```js

pow(1, 2)
// 1

pow(2, 10)
// 1024

pow(4, -1)
// 0.25
```

All inputs are safe.

**Follow-up**

You can easily solve this problem by multiplying the base one after another, but it is slow. For power of `n`, it is needed to do the multiplication `n` times, can you think of a faster solution ?
