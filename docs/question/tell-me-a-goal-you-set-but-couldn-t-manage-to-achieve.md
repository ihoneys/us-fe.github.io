## Question
A similar question to [Tell me a goal you set and you managed to achieve.](https://bigfrontend.dev/question/Tell-me-a-goal-you-set-and-you-managed-to-achieve)

It is fine to set a goal that is hard to meet. Yet interviewers want to believe you can do the evaluation with reason, and you are able to adjust the goal accordingly.

Prepare for this with **a solid real case** , use a case that could interest the interviewer to ask more about it.

When speaking, follow this template: situation → obstacles → actions → result
