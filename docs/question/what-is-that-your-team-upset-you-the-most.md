# What is that your team upset you the most?

## Question
Don't say things too personal. Better mention things about the team culture, and let interviewers know that you are already trying improve it with clear plans.

Prepare for this with **a solid real case** to show your **unique value**, use a case that could interest the interviewer to ask more about it.

When speaking, follow this template: situation → obstacles → actions → result
