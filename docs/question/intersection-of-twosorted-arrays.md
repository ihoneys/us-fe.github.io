# Intersection of two sorted arrays

Given 2 sorted array of integers, find the elements that exist in both arrays.

```js
intersect(
  [1,2,2,3,4,4],
  [2,2,4,5,5,6,2000]
)
// [2,2,4]
```

1.  The arrays might have duplicate numbers.
2.  The order of returning result doesn't matter.
3.  What is the time & space cost of your approach? Could you improve it?
