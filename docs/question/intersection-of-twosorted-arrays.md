# Intersection of two sorted arrays

## Question
Given 2 sorted array of integers, find the elements that exist in both arrays.

```js
intersect(
  [1,2,2,3,4,4],
  [2,2,4,5,5,6,2000]
)
// [2,2,4]
```

1.  The arrays might have duplicate numbers.
2.  The order of returning result doesn't matter.
3.  What is the time & space cost of your approach? Could you improve it?

## Code
:::: code-group
::: code-group-item javascript:active
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr1 - integers
 * @param {number[]} arr2 - integers
 * @returns {number[]}
 */
function intersect(arr1, arr2) {
  // your code here
}
```
