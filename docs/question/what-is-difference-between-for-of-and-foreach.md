# What is difference between `for ... of` and `forEach`

## Question
We could use [for...of](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) and [Array.prototype.forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) to apply functions agains elements in an array.

What is the difference?

Notice that `for...of` is iterating but `forEach` is not, this makes a huge difference in running async functions. [This article](https://thecodebarbarian.com/for-vs-for-each-vs-for-in-vs-for-of-in-javascript.html) explains very well on this.
