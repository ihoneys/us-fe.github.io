# implement Binary Search (unique)

Even in Front-End review, basic algorithm technique like [Binary Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) are likely to be asked.

You are given an **unique & ascending** array of integers, please search for its index with Binary Search.

If not found, return `-1`

_note_

Please don't use `Array.prototype.indexOf()`, it is not our goal.
