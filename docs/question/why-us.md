# Why us?

## Question
It is good to be **ambitious**, not good to be **greedy** (on money) or **whatever**.

Investigate the company's business model and culture, ask yourself why you want to join them.

It better be on yourself's future but not about the compensation.

Don't say bad words about your current employer, interviewer might follow up on that.
