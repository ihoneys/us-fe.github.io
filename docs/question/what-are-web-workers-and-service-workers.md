# What are Web Workers and Service Workers ? 

Don't mess them up. [Web worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) and [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) are different web apis.

Be sure to understand what each is good at and their restrictions.
