# explain how different CSS `position` property works

## Question
if you can mention `position: sticky` and [stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context), definitely would shine out.

Nothing fancy, just need to remember [all the position rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position)
