# What would you do if your progress is dragged own by other teams?

## Question
A common problem in a big company.

Interviewers want to see you **take ownership**, when delay happens, don't just wait but try yourself to push the project forward even it is not your responsibility.

Try to keep everyone informed of each other's progress, find the risk as early as possbile.

Prepare for this with **a solid real case** to show your **unique value**, use a case that could interest the interviewer to ask more about it.

When speaking, follow this template: situation → obstacles → actions → result
