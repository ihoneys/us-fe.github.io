# center an element vertically

This is a very basic question and good to be the first CSS problem on BFE.dev.

Suppose you have an HTML structure as below

```html
<div class="outer">
  <div class="inner">
</div>
```

Please center the inner div vertically without changing their dimensions and colors.
