# explain `this` keyword in JavaScript

`this` behaves differently in different situations, you should clearly list up all the cases, from common cases to rare ones.

if you are not familiar with it yet, please read [this article from MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) first.

It would help if you clearly state the case of Arrow Function
