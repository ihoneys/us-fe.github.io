# `Array.prototype.forEach()` vs `Array.prototype.map()`

## Question
An easy question, right?

It really depends on what you want to achieve.

In case you are not sure, read MDN about [forEach()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) and [map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)
