# find the K-th largest element in an unsorted array

You are given an unsorted array of numbers, which might have duplicates, find the K-th largest element.

The naive approach would be sort it first, but it costs `O(nlogn)`, could you find a better approach?

Maybe you can recall what is happening in [Quick Sort](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-Quick-Sort) or [Priority Queue](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/create-a-priority-queue-in-JavaScript)
