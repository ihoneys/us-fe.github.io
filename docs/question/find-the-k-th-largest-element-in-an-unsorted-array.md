# find the K-th largest element in an unsorted array

## Question
You are given an unsorted array of numbers, which might have duplicates, find the K-th largest element.

The naive approach would be sort it first, but it costs `O(nlogn)`, could you find a better approach?

Maybe you can recall what is happening in [Quick Sort](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-Quick-Sort) or [Priority Queue](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/create-a-priority-queue-in-JavaScript)

## Code
:::: code-group
::: code-group-item javascript:active
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @param {number} k
 */
function findKThLargest(arr, k) {
  // your code here
}
```
