# create a WYSIWYG editor

WYSIWYG(**W**hat **Y**ou **S**ee **I**s **W**hat **Y**ou **G**et) editors are very common on the internet. Such as Google docs .etc

Get familiar with one of the editors you frequently use, and think about

1.  what components it has
2.  how should it be implemented.

Considering the vagueness, you should narrow down the scope at the beginning of your interview.
