# Your decision proved to be wrong, how do you receive feedback?

Everyone makes mistakes. Just don't make same mistake twice.

Be modest, Be objective and don't take it personal when receiving feedback.

Prepare for this with **a solid real case** to show your **unique value**, use a case that could interest the interviewer to ask more about it.

When speaking, follow this template: situation → obstacles → actions → result
