# a row

## Question
Suppose we have a row structured as below:

```html
<div class="row"></div>
```

Please complete the CSS according to following requirements:

1.  height 50px
2.  set background to `#eee`, but if there are adjacent rows, set even rows' background to `#ddd`
3.  set 1px border on top & bottom with color `#ccc`, but if there are adjacent rows, adjacent borders should be collapsed into one

> if you have to decide which row to dispplay both top and bottom border, add it to first row, [ref](https://bigfrontend.dev/css/7/discuss/8065?focus=8082)
