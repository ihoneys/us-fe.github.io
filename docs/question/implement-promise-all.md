# implement `Promise.all()`

> The Promise.all() method takes an iterable of promises as an input, and returns a single Promise that resolves to an array of the results of the input promises

source - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all)

Could you write your own `all()` ? which should works the same as `Promise.all()`

_note_

**Do not use Promise.all() directly**, it is not helping
