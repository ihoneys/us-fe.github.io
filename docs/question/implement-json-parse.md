# implement JSON.parse()

This is a follow-up on [21\. implement JSON.stringify()](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-JSON-stringify).

Believe you are already familiar with `JSON.parse()`, could you implement your own version?

In case you are not sure about the spec, [MDN here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) might help.

`JSON.parse()` support a second parameter `reviver`, you can ignore that.

_note_

**Don't use JSON.parse() in your code here** It doesn't help you practicing your skills.
