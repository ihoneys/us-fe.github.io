# Tell me about a time that you failed.

Failure is totally fine. Interviewer wants to believe that you could learn from it.

Prepare for this with **a solid real case** to show that

1.  you made mistakes but you never make same mistakes twice
2.  you could make things even better after the mistakes
3.  you don't hide mistakes, you think about the whole picture

When speaking, follow this template: situation → obstacles → actions → result
