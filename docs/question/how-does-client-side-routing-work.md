# How does client-side routing work?

If you have used react-router before, you must know there are 3 kinds of router,

1.  BrowserRouter
2.  HashRouter
3.  MemoryRouter

What is the difference of them ? How did they work ?

To best understand this, you are suggested to write your own client-side router, with

1.  [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState) and [popstate event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/popstate_event)
    
2.  [onhashchange](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onhashchange)
