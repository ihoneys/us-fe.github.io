# What is the differencee between Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption?

## Question
This question is critical to understand how HTTPs works, in case you are still not familiar, I suggest you take a look at [this article](https://www.clickssl.net/blog/symmetric-encryption-vs-asymmetric-encryption).

Besides there is also [Web Crypto APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) to create web apps with cryptography.
