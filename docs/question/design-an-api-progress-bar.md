# Design an API progress bar

You must have seen a lot of web application using a global progress bar at the top of the page, indicating APIs are in progress.

How would you create one?

This looks easy, but actually needs to be careful. Maybe you could share some thoughts on **natural animation**, **multiple API case**, **error case**, **timeout**, **fast & slow request**, **state management**, **modularization**, **API cancellation** .etc
