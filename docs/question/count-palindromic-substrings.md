# Count palindromic substrings

## Question
A palindromic string reads the same backward as forward, such as `'madam'`.

Now given a string, count how many substrings it has?

Like `'madam'`, it has following palindromic strings:

```js
'm'
'a'
'd'
'a'
'm'
'ada'
'madam'
```

What is the time and space cost of your solution ? Could you improve it ?
