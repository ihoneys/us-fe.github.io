# Find the largest difference

Given an array of numbers, pick any two numbers `a` and `b`, we could get the difference by `Math.abs(a - b)`.

Can you write a function to get the largest difference?

```js

largestDiff([-1, 2,3,10, 9])
// 11,  obviously Math.abs(-1 - 10) is the largest

largestDiff([])
// 0

largestDiff([1])
// 0
```
