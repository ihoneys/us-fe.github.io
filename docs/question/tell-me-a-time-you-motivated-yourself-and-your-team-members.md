# Tell me a time you motivated yourself and your team members.

This question is similar to [88\. Tell me a time you achieved something through good collaboration.](https://bigfrontend.dev/question/Tell-me-a-time-you-achieved-something0-through-good-collaboration.)

Show the interviewer that you are a team player.

Prepare for this with **a solid real case** to show your **unique value**, use a case that could interest the interviewer to ask more about it.

When speaking, follow this template: situation → obstacles → actions → result
