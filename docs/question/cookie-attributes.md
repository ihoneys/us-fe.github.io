# What attributes do Cookies have?

## Question
Basic attributes like max-age/expire/domain/path and other security attributes like secure/httpOnly/same-site, .etc. [MDN explanation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie) is a good reading material.

Also don't forget the [Cookie Prefixes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#Cookie_prefixes).
