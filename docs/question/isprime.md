## Question
A [Prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) is a natural number greater than 1 that is divisible only by itself and 1, such as 2,3,5....

You are asked to implement `isPrime()` to check if a number is prime.

**Follow-up**

What is the time cost of your implementation ? can you improve your approach to have the fewest comparisons?

## Code
:::: code-group
::: code-group-item javascript:active
```javascript
