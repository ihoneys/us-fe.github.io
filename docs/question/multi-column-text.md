# multi-column text

## Question
It is very common to see text in multiple columns on newspaper, please achieve something similar in this problem.

Suppose you have HTML structure like below.

```html
<div class="three-column-text">
  some very very long text
</div>
```

Complete the CSS code according to following requirements

1.  divide into 3 columns
2.  use 1px line of `#ddd` as separator
3.  adding 10px space around each column, to container border and to the separator

> The text used in test doesn't contain space but has forced line break to show padding/margin clearly.
