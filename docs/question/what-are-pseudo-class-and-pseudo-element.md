# What are Pseudo Class and Pseudo Element?

Well we use them everyday, can you describe them clearly?

Please remember the _terms_ from the MDN docs for [Pseudo Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) and [Pseudo Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) are a good start
