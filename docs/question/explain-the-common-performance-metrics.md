# Explain the common performance metrics

## Question
In order to do performance tuning we need to first know how to evaluate the performance.

Here are metrics used in Chrome Lighthouse, can you explain them ?

[First Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint/)

[First Meaningful Paint](https://web.dev/first-meaningful-paint)

[Speed Index](https://web.dev/speed-index)

[First CPU Idle](https://web.dev/first-cpu-idle)

[Time To Interactive](https://web.dev/interactive)

[First Input Delay](https://web.dev/fid)

[Total Blocking Time](https://web.dev/lighthouse-total-blocking-time/)

[Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/lcp/)

[Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)](https://web.dev/cls/)

well some of them are deprecated. It would be great if you can talk about your past experience of using one of them.
