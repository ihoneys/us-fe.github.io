# Design a messenger web app

Please design a messenger app, like [Facebook Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/).

Super vague problem, please clarify scope with your interviewer.

Different from other timeline-based product, messenger is for realtime chatting, so things like **how to make it realtime**, **offline problem**, **read status**, **group**, **server performance** could be your shining points.

Good luck!
