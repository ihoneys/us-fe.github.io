# what is the difference between `block` and `inline`?

## Question
Seems to be an easy one, but even for the simplest question we could do our best to shine.

To answer this question, maybe we could mention [Normal Flow(CSS Flow Layout)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flow_Layout) and [Formatting Context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flow_Layout/Intro_to_formatting_contexts)
