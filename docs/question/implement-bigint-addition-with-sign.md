# implement BigInt addition with sign

This is a follow-up on [62\. implement BigInt addition](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/add-BigInt-string).

You are asked to implement a string addition function, **with possible negative integers**. Also, '+' plus sign should also be supported

```js
add('-999999999999999999', '-1')
// '-1000000000000000000'

add('-999999999999999999', '+1')
// '-999999999999999998'
```

Don't use BigInt directly, it is not our goal here.
