# Explain `new` operator in JavaScript. What exactly does it do?

It is not enough to answer that [new operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new) is to create an object, rather you should explain the exact steps in details.

There is also a coding problem for this on bfe.dev [60\. create your own `new` operator](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/create-your-own-new-operator)
