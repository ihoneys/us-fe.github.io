# What is the difference between `async` and `defer` on script tag?

## Question
Common question to be asked, you need to first explain the that default script tag is parser blocking, and then how `defer` and `async` comes to rescue.

[This article](https://bitsofco.de/async-vs-defer/) explains pretty well, and this [article from google about critical rendering path](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path) is worth reading
