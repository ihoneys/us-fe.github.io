# Design Twitter Web App

## Question
It is cool that Twitter adopts PWA and supports mobile, desktop and even wraps PWA into desktop native apps.

Seems that Twitter is also using [react-native-for-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web).

Ok, to design Twitter web app

1.  spend some time on [twitter.com](https://twitter.com), and [mobile.twitter.com](https://mobile.twitter.com)
2.  find the bottleneck or interesting feature you wanna talk about
3.  organize your topics with priority
