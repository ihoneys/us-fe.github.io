# How to detect crash of a web page?

## Question
A very interesting question. `onbeforeunload` could be used to let us know right before a page is unloaded.

But if the web page crashes, the JavaScript doesn't even have chance to run.

So how could we know that a web page crashed because of unexpected reasons?
