# implement BigInt addition

Luckily we have [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt) in JavaScript so handle big numbers.

What if we need to do it by ourselves for older browsers?

You are asked to implement a string addition function, **with all non-negative integers in string**.

```js
add('999999999999999999', '1')
// '1000000000000000000'
```

Don't use BigInt directly, it is not our goal here.
