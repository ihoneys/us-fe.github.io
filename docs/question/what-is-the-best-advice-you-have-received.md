# What is the best advice you have received?

There must be something you find it so right that you behave on it.

It better be related to your proficiency of your job.

Prepare for this with **a solid real case** to show your **unique value**, use a case that could interest the interviewer to ask more about it.

When speaking, follow this template: situation → obstacles → actions → result
