# What is CSRF? How to prevent it?

## Question
Common question being asked at an interview.

You must understand why this is a problem, what it can lead to and how to prevent it.

Mentioning `SameSite` definitely gonna shine you up, because it is fairly new technique.

[This article](https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/csrf-cross-site-request-forgery/) explains this so well that I recommend you read it thoroughly.
