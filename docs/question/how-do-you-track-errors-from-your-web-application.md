# How do you track errors from your web application?

## Question
Explain this in following steps.

1.  what **kind** of errors there are
2.  how do you **detect** errors
3.  **how** do you report errors
4.  **when** do you report errors
5.  how do you **store** the error logs
6.  how do you **prioritize** the errors
7.  ...etc

It would be great if you can explain it with real project experiences.
