# How do you handle a challenge?

You must have a general methodology to every challenge. Interviewers want to believe you can handle any challenges, or at least have approaches.

Prepare for this with **a solid real case** to show your **unique value**, use a case that could interest the interviewer to ask more about it.

When speaking, follow this template: situation → obstacles → actions → result
