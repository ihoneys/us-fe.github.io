# is  Array.prototype.sort() stable in JavaScript?

## Question
[ECMAScript Spec](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array.prototype.sort) requires Array.prototype.sort() to be stable, but actually Chrome V8 only made it stable in 2018, 10 years after [the issue was reported](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=90).

[The detail of what algorithm is used in V8](https://v8.dev/blog/array-sort) is worth well reading.
