# implement BigInt subtraction with sign

This is a follow-up on [75\. implement BigInt subtraction](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-BigInt-subtraction).

You are asked to implement a string substraction function, **with possible negative integers**. Also, '+' plus sign should also be supported

```js
substract('-999999999999999999', '-1')
// '-999999999999999998'

substract('-999999999999999999', '+1')
// '-1000000000000000000'
```

Don't use BigInt directly, it is not our goal here.
