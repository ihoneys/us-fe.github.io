# What are the time and space complexity for sorting algorithms

## Question
FrontEnd engineer interviews are usually not about difficult algorithm problems. Yet still it is a must to comprehend the cost of common sorting algorithms.

First you should remember how many sorting algorithms are there, and how they work.

Then you should answer the average time/space complexity for each, and also the worst case for each.

Don't forget to mention the stability.
