# create a counter object

Create an object with property `count`, which increments every time `count` is accessed, initial value is 0.

```js
const counter = createCounter()
counter.count // 0, then it should increment
counter.count // 1
counter.count // 2
counter.count = 100 // it cannot be altered
counter.count // 3
```
