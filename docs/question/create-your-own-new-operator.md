# create your own `new` operator

[`new` operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new) is used to create new instance objects.

Do you know exactly what `new` does?

You are asked to implement `myNew()`, which should return an object just as what `new` does but without using `new`.

Pay attention to the return type of constructor.
