# Tell us about CSS keywords: initial/inherit/unset/revert

## Question
They are not that commonly used, but if you create some common components, they might be very useful.

MDN is good enough to get hold of them: [initial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/initial), [unset](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/initial), [inherit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inherit) and [revert](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/revert).
