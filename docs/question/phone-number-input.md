# phone number input

Create a `PhoneNumberInput` component.

1.  only accepts numerical digits
2.  format the number automatically as `(123)456-7890` by

*   adding the parenthesis when the 4th digit is entered
*   also adding `-` before 7th digit

You can use the default text input without any styling.

### Follow-up

What if user removes some digits in the middle, does caret jumps to the end in your approach?

> caret position is not covered in our tests.
