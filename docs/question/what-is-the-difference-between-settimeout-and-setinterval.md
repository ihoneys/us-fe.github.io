# What is the difference between setTimeout and setInterval?

First please understand [46\. Explain Event Loop in Browser and in Node.js](https://bigfrontend.dev/question/Explain-Event-Loop-in-Browser-and-in-Nodejs).

`setTimeout` could be used to mimic(sort of) the behavior of `setInterval`, there is an big difference between them though. [This article on JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/settimeout-setinterval) explains it very well.
