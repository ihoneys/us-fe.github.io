# implement `Promise.race()`

This problem is similar to [31\. implement async helper - `race()`](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-async-helper-race), but with Promise.

> The Promise.race() method returns a promise that fulfills or rejects as soon as one of the promises in an iterable fulfills or rejects, with the value or reason from that promise. [source: MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race)

Can you create a `race()` which works the same as `Promise.race()`?
