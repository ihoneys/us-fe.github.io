# can you tell the difference between MVC, MVVM and Flux?

## Question
It would be great if you can talk about these high-level architecture topics. [This article](https://www.mobindustry.net/how-to-choose-a-perfect-architecture-for-ios-mvc-vs-mvvm-vs-redux/) is helpful to understand the differences.

Do notice that they are different concepts born in different times adapting to the evolving platforms, so don't just compare the good and bad without understanding the background.

To have a intuitive idea , you can think that in an web app built with Backbone/Angular.js/React, what you need to do in order to update the UI when data changes.
