# implement String.prototype.trim()

## Question
[String.prototype.trim()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/Trim) is commonly used when processing strings.

It is very easy, can you implement your own one?

There are many ways to do it, can you think of different approaches?

## Code
:::: code-group
::: code-group-item javascript:active
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} str
 * @return {string}
 */
function trim(str) {
  // your code here
}
```
