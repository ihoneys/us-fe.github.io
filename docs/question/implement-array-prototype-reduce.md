# implement Array.prototype.reduce()

[Array.prototype.reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) is a handy method to process arrays.

Here is a simple task - **Could you implement it by yourself?**

```ts
[1,2,3].myReduce((sum, item) => sum + item)
// 6
```

1.  do not use native Array.prototype.reduce() in your code
2.  your function is only tested against valid array (no array-like objects)
3.  thanks to [pajadev](https://bigfrontend.dev/category/5/discuss/693?focus=859) for suggesting this
