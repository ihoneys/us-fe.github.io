# How does HMR(Hot Module Replacement) work in Webpack?

You use webpack's HMR(Hot Module Replacement) every day, have you wondered how it works?

This is the [official document](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/).

It has only text, so maybe [this article](https://medium.com/@rajaraodv/webpack-hot-module-replacement-hmr-e756a726a07) is more easy to understand.
